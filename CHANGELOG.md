# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Runs on Windows, as a per-user installer that registers `.tikzcd`, or as a portable executable. Neither is signed, so SmartScreen warns the first time.
- A windowed program on Windows has no console, so `--help` and `--version` open a dialog there.
- Saving retries the rename over the diagram. Windows can refuse the rename for a moment while an indexer, a scanner, or a sync client holds the file open.
- The `macros.tex` search stops at the home directory on Windows too. The same path can be spelt in more than one case there, and the old comparison missed it.
- A complaint about `settings.json` or `keys` names the directory holding them, rather than always `~/.config/sagitta`.
- `|` types itself instead of wrapping the label or bringing a closing `|`, since it is as often a restriction or "divides" as an absolute value. It still pairs after `\left`, and `\|` and `\lvert` still pair.

## 0.1.0

First public release, for Linux only, as an AppImage or from source.

- Edits `.tikzcd` files that a paper `\input`s directly, with quiver's encoding on the first line and a byte-for-byte round trip.
- Keyboard-driven: spreadsheet-style labels, the `;` command layer, the `:` command line, `/` search by label or code, and `C-/` help.
- Usable by mouse: right-click or the mode line's `; commands` button opens the command layer, whose lines are clickable, and the help lists the mouse's gestures.
- Labels render with the nearest `macros.tex`, reloaded when it changes.
- A keys file (`~/.config/sagitta/keys`) rebinds keys, and `settings.json` holds the settings, which the settings layer (`C-,`) changes.
- The command layer lists its keys after a short wait (`?` at once), or in a compact form.
